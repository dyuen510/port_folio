        Front End Web Developer with a background in Business Administration
        within the finance industry and a dedication to continuous learning with
        hands on experiences. Known as an individual with great attention to
        detail, positive attitude, and calm demeanor in high stress situations.
        I have always enjoyed seeing others learn by doing and really believe in
        peer to peer teaching. Seeing my parents filled with astonishment over
        disruptive and new technology made me motivated professionally to be
        part of a team to create innovative products.

        My past projects have focused mainly at the full functionality of the
        applications using MERN which aims to improve productivity of users.
        Multiple projects during my undergrad have prepared me to be a great
        team player by motivating my group to get started and equally share the
        workload.
