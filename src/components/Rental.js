        Travel Thailand website is designed to bring convenience and ease when booking rental homes in Thailand by utilizing simple to understand features. We want to focus on Thailand and primarily allow users to choose from regions or cities in Thailand. We want to increase userâ€™s satisfaction by giving them efficient search query results.

        <p>Role: UX designer designing the Whale Project from conception to delivery </p>
        <p style={{color:'red'}}>The challenge is to design an accessible website for finding rental homes in Thailand.</p>
        <p>The goal is to design an app that is easy to use with low drop off rates. By doing a usability study I measured
            the time on task, drop off rates and user error rates to see if there are any possible changes needed to improve user's experience.

        <p>Designing this project, I learned how to wireframe on adobe XD and utilized layers to help 
            organize the content. Since this is a travel project I realized that a language selection and a currency selection
            will help users with accessibility. Also a clear navigation with corresponding icons can help users navigate throughout the project
            and provide assistance throughout their user journey. My next steps is to conduct another usability study on the final design to see if there
            are any challenges that were not noticed in the past studies. </p>
